UX Requirements

Use a left sidebar navigation on desktop and bottom/mobile navigation on mobile.

Make the dashboard the primary experience.

Use realistic sample data instead of empty placeholders.

Add hover states, loading states, empty states, success states, and error states.

Add smooth but subtle animations.

Use reusable components.

Maintain consistent spacing, typography, cards, buttons, icons, and navigation.

Make every major interaction functional.

Do not create a static mockup; build an actual working frontend.

Recommended Visual Style

Use:

White / warm-white backgrounds

Black/dark charcoal text

Soft gray borders

Subtle beige/neutral accents

One restrained premium accent color

Minimal gradients

Elegant charts and progress indicators

High-quality icons

Large typography for important goals and identity statements

Tech

Use React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS with a clean component architecture.

For now, use mock/local data and frontend state where backend functionality is not available. Structure the code so APIs and authentication can easily be connected later.

The final result should feel like a real premium AI product ready for a startup demo, not a generic admin dashboard.
